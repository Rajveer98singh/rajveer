        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Hey there! I’m Rajveer, a software developer with a B.Tech in Engineering Physics from IIT Delhi. My journey hasn’t been a straightforward one, but let me walk you through it. This blog is all about my experiences at IIT Delhi, the decisions I made, and how they shaped my life. It’s also a mix of life lessons, fun experiences, and a bit of swimming and Formula Racing thrown in! I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed living it.</p>

            <h3>The Early Days: JNV & School Life</h3>
            <p>I come from a middle-class family, and things weren’t always easy. But one of the best decisions I made early on was attending <span class="highlight">Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (JNV)</span>. If you don’t know, JNV is a school that fosters top-tier talent, and my time there shaped my future in more ways than I could have imagined. From the 6th to the 10th grade, I studied there and focused on science and math. These subjects became the foundation of my mindset shift. My dad, who’s a government science and math teacher, always encouraged me to dive deep into these subjects. Though he never directly taught me, his advice stuck with me.</p>
            <p>During my time at JNV, I also cracked the ultimate <span class="highlight">life hack</span>: self-motivation. This is what I believe is the secret to succeeding in the 21st century. Once you figure that out, the rest just falls into place.</p>

            <h3>From Kota to IIT Delhi: The JEE Saga</h3>
            <p>After finishing 10th, I decided to pursue engineering. Naturally, I joined the <span class="highlight">coaching center in Kota</span>, where I spent three years preparing for JEE. I won’t lie, I failed JEE Advanced the first time. But hey, failing isn’t the end of the world, right? I used my second attempt to study harder and finally cleared it. This journey taught me a lot about <span class="highlight">hard work</span>, <span class="highlight">consistency</span>, and <span class="highlight">dedication</span>. One thing I realized is that you can’t expect miracles overnight.</p>
            <p>After clearing JEE, I had to make another big decision: where to go? I was offered <span class="highlight">Civil Engineering at IIT Kanpur</span>, but I chose <span class="highlight">IIT Delhi</span> because of its prestige, location, and the opportunities I’d get. I decided to pursue <span class="highlight">Engineering Physics</span> because it seemed like the best fit. Fast forward a year, and I realized physics wasn’t for me. So, I decided to switch gears and pursue a corporate job after graduation. Life, right?</p>

            <h3>College Life: Swimming, Formula Racing, and Making Memories</h3>
            <p>Let’s talk about <span class="highlight">college life</span>—where the real learning happens. IIT Delhi offered a ton of opportunities, and I made the most of it. I got involved in <span class="highlight">sports</span> (though I didn’t stick to football, which I played at the state level during school). I dabbled in squash, tennis, and basketball, but the one sport that really clicked with me was <span class="highlight">swimming</span>.</p>
            <p>When I joined the Olympic-sized swimming pool at IIT Delhi, I didn’t know how to swim. But I’m the kind of person who learns by watching and copying. Within two months, I went from struggling with basic strokes to mastering the <span class="highlight">butterfly stroke</span>. By my second year, I was the <span class="highlight">vice-captain</span> of the hostel swimming team. Swimming taught me how adaptable I am when I need to learn something new quickly.</p>
            <p>I also joined the <span class="highlight">Axcelerator Group</span>, IIT Delhi’s <span class="highlight">Formula Racing Team</span>. Working with the team taught me how difficult it is to build a race car. I gave it my best shot, but ultimately, I couldn’t cope with the workload, so I quit. However, the <span class="highlight">car spirit</span> still lives on in me, and one day, I plan to build my own car. No promises on when, though!</p>

            <h3>Academics: Engineering Physics and Learning Beyond the Classroom</h3>
            <p>Now, onto the <span class="highlight">academics</span>. IIT Delhi is known for offering a ton of courses across different departments. During my time there, I took courses in <span class="highlight">Electrical</span> and <span class="highlight">CSE</span> in addition to my core <span class="highlight">Physics</span> courses. This gave me a broad perspective and helped me explore interests I didn’t even know I had.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Engineering Physics</span> is ideal for anyone interested in research. It’s the perfect foundation for fields like <span class="highlight">superconductors</span>, <span class="highlight">laser physics</span>, and <span class="highlight">nanotechnology</span>. A lot of my batchmates are currently pursuing <span class="highlight">master’s</span> or <span class="highlight">PhDs</span> abroad. If you’re planning to go down that route, my advice is simple: <span class="highlight">aim for a CGPA of 8.5 or higher</span> to make your life easier. As for me, I chose to go the <span class="highlight">corporate</span> route, so my CGPA ended up around 7, which is considered pretty decent at IIT.</p>
            <p>And let me tell you about the <span class="highlight">faculty</span>—the professors at IIT Delhi are incredibly knowledgeable. They are the best at what they do, and you’ll realize just how much you can learn from them once you get there. Another great thing about IIT Delhi is the <span class="highlight">freedom</span>. You can take courses from almost any department, which is why I also did some CSE and Electrical courses alongside my physics ones. It was an amazing experience.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion: College Life and Learning Beyond Books</h3>
            <p>To sum it all up, my journey to IIT Delhi has been full of ups and downs. But looking back, I wouldn’t change a thing. The experiences, the lessons, the people—I’ll cherish them forever. My advice to anyone currently in college (or planning to join) is: <span class="highlight">don’t just focus on studies</span>. Get involved in extracurriculars, sports, or cultural activities. They help you grow as a person and give you experiences that no textbook can provide. College is about making memories, and trust me, they’ll last you a lifetime.</p>
